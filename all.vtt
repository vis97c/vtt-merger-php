07:48.000 --> 07:53.234
Be very quiet, not a word.

07:54.501 --> 07:58.401
Everyone gather around here.

08:01.267 --> 08:06.367
Quietly, silently, here we are.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.200
Quiet!

08:24.134 --> 08:26.600
Everything is silent.

08:29.700 --> 08:30.000
There's no one near.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.967
There's no one near.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.200
We'll sing our song...

08:42.067 --> 08:44.034
...and no one will be disturbed.

08:59.666 --> 09:00.000
Fiorello, you're there?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.067
Fiorello, you're there?

09:02.401 --> 09:05.566
Count, I'm right here.

09:05.666 --> 09:08.165
Good.  And our friends?

09:08.166 --> 09:10.967
They're all ready.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.300
Just be quiet.

09:18.401 --> 09:22.300
Very quiet.  Not a word!

09:33.533 --> 09:34.967
Not a word!

10:56.401 --> 11:00.000
There, smiling in the sky...

11:00.000 --> 11:01.566
There, smiling in the sky...

11:05.900 --> 11:11.434
...the lovely dawn is breaking.

11:16.334 --> 11:21.401
And you are not yet awake?

11:27.666 --> 11:30.000
How can you still be sleeping?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.967
How can you still be sleeping?

11:39.633 --> 11:44.901
Awake, my dearest love.

11:50.434 --> 11:56.103
Come, my treasured one.

12:01.566 --> 12:07.501
Soften the pain, oh, Lord...

12:20.034 --> 12:26.267
...of the dart that pierces me.

12:32.167 --> 12:39.100
Love's dart has wounded me.

12:52.087 --> 12:57.612
Oh, do I see that dearest vision?

13:04.100 --> 13:08.434
Will she take pity on a man in love?

13:15.800 --> 13:20.767
Oh, sweet moment of love.

13:22.434 --> 13:27.501
Oh, happy contentment.

13:49.467 --> 13:54.633
Such joy has no equal.

15:02.833 --> 15:04.967
Did you see her?

15:08.733 --> 15:12.533
All my hopes are in vain.

15:12.867 --> 15:18.434
Count, dawn is breaking.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.700
What do I care?

15:23.434 --> 15:24.333
What can I do?

15:26.300 --> 15:30.000
It's hopeless, good people.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.800
It's hopeless, good people.

15:39.501 --> 15:42.666
No more singing or playing.

15:43.900 --> 15:47.900
I don't need you anymore.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.933
There's nothing more you can do.

16:10.666 --> 16:14.067
A thousand thanks for the honor, sir.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.300
Stop your noise!

16:27.533 --> 16:30.000
Curse you all!  Go away!

16:30.000 --> 16:30.700
Curse you all!  Go away!

16:33.933 --> 16:37.234
A curse on you noisy rabble!

16:52.733 --> 16:56.134
Curse you all!  Go away!

17:46.200 --> 17:47.712
Disgusting rabble!

17:48.134 --> 17:53.267
They almost woke up
the whole neighborhood.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.000
Who's coming now?

18:00.000 --> 18:00.034
Who's coming now?

18:02.700 --> 18:06.100
I'll hide over there.

18:06.967 --> 18:11.301
It's past dawn,
but love makes lovers bold!

18:48.234 --> 18:51.500
Make way for the factotum of the city!

18:55.100 --> 18:58.533
I'm at my shop
even before dawn fades.

19:03.733 --> 19:09.034
What a life!  The pleasures are great...

19:10.034 --> 19:13.833
...for a barber of quality.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.967
Good for you, Figaro!

19:22.900 --> 19:25.733
I'm a very lucky man.

19:49.434 --> 19:52.800
I'm in motion night and day.

19:52.967 --> 19:56.267
No barber could do better.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.101
Razors and scissors,
all at my fingertips.

20:13.933 --> 20:21.067
Then there are the extras...business
for ladies and for gentlemen.

20:39.466 --> 20:44.734
It's a fine life
and the pleasures are great...

20:45.401 --> 20:49.401
...for a hair stylist who's first rate!

20:52.134 --> 20:58.167
Everyone wants me...
children, old men, young maidens...

20:58.833 --> 21:00.000
...for a wig, a shave, a tooth that aches!

21:00.000 --> 21:03.533
...for a wig, a shave, a tooth that aches!

21:22.733 --> 21:27.134
One at a time, for heaven's sake!

21:38.334 --> 21:43.733
Figaro?  I'm here.
Figaro?  I'm there.

21:50.533 --> 21:56.100
I'm ready for all escapades.
I'm the jack-of-all-trades!

22:00.967 --> 22:05.267
Figaro, you're a marvel!
Your fortune is made!

22:11.466 --> 22:16.101
I'm the factotum of the city!

22:59.167 --> 23:00.000
What a good life.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.867
What a good life.

23:01.034 --> 23:05.167
My pockets are always jingling...

23:05.267 --> 23:07.833
...due to my great reputation.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.700
Without Figaro,
no girl in Seville can marry.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.566
The widows run to me for a husband.

23:14.666 --> 23:19.867
With a comb by day
and a guitar by night...

23:20.000 --> 23:24.533
...I can honestly say,
I satisfy everyone.

23:24.700 --> 23:27.134
Oh, what a life!

23:27.933 --> 23:29.633
What a trade!

23:30.800 --> 23:32.567
Now to work!

23:33.334 --> 23:35.466
Am I mistaken?

23:35.800 --> 23:37.067
Who's this now?

23:37.733 --> 23:40.234
No, it must be...Figaro!

23:42.234 --> 23:44.067
Oh, your Excellency!

23:47.600 --> 23:52.832
Quiet, I don't want anyone
to know who I am.

23:52.833 --> 23:55.134
Of course, Sir...I'll be on my way.

23:59.933 --> 24:00.000
I ran into you at just the right moment.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.267
I ran into you at just the right moment.

24:05.267 --> 24:09.200
You rogue, what are you doing
in this part of the world?

24:09.633 --> 24:13.666
And looking so fat and prosperous!

24:13.833 --> 24:16.334
Looks are deceiving!

24:18.100 --> 24:19.433
You're behaving yourself?

24:23.800 --> 24:25.566
But why are you in Seville?

24:27.900 --> 24:30.000
On the Prado,
I saw a flower of beauty.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.434
On the Prado,
I saw a flower of beauty.

24:33.533 --> 24:37.034
The daughter of an old doctor
who moved here.

24:37.867 --> 24:43.234
I fell madly in love,
left Madrid and came here.

24:43.367 --> 24:49.334
And here I wait, night and day...
under her balcony.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.967
That balcony?  A doctor?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.967
You're in luck!

24:55.300 --> 24:59.401
The cheese fell right on your macaroni!

25:02.034 --> 25:08.433
I'm their barber, apothecary,
and veterinarian. I run the household.

25:10.501 --> 25:14.234
The doctor isn't the girl's father,
only her guardian.

25:16.434 --> 25:18.700
Someone's on the balcony!

25:23.334 --> 25:25.900
He hasn't come yet.

25:27.300 --> 25:28.827
My life, my love!

25:29.034 --> 25:30.000
My treasure!  There you are at last.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.834
My treasure!  There you are at last.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.833
(How will I give him this note?)

25:41.401 --> 25:45.967
Nice weather today....
what's that paper?

25:48.700 --> 25:53.900
Just the lyrics of an aria
from "The Useless Precaution."

25:54.200 --> 25:56.967
Clever! "The Useless Precaution!"

25:57.233 --> 26:00.000
What is this "Useless Precaution?"

26:01.034 --> 26:05.600
The title of a lovely new opera.

26:07.367 --> 26:12.367
Today there's no such thing as music.

26:12.700 --> 26:18.733
Only long tedious nonsense
no one can stand.

26:18.900 --> 26:22.700
Idiot public!  Degenerate artists!

26:23.871 --> 26:26.221
I dropped the aria.

26:26.834 --> 26:28.800
Get it right away.

26:42.366 --> 26:45.400
Here I am.  Where is it?

26:45.700 --> 26:48.533
The wind blew it away.  Look for it.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.666
I don't see it.

26:59.334 --> 27:00.000
(She tricked me!)

27:00.000 --> 27:01.900
(She tricked me!)

27:02.200 --> 27:04.267
Get back in the house!

27:09.334 --> 27:14.467
I'll have that balcony walled up!
Get inside!

27:14.933 --> 27:19.234
Oh, what a horrible life!

27:21.767 --> 27:23.300
Unhappy girl.

27:23.666 --> 27:26.666
I'm more intrigued by her than ever.

27:27.467 --> 27:29.434
Let's see her note.

27:38.767 --> 27:42.134
"Your constant attention
has aroused my curiosity."

27:42.633 --> 27:45.067
"My guardian will go out soon."

27:46.733 --> 27:54.267
"Find some ingenious way to tell me
your name, position, and intentions."

27:55.401 --> 28:00.000
"I would do anything to break my chains.
Your unfortunate Rosina."

28:00.000 --> 28:01.633
"I would do anything to break my chains.
Your unfortunate Rosina."

28:02.434 --> 28:04.266
She shall break them!

28:04.267 --> 28:05.710
Look, the door is opening!

28:12.434 --> 28:17.700
I'll be back soon.
Don't let anyone in.

28:18.800 --> 28:23.100
If Don Basilio comes, have him wait.

28:35.134 --> 28:41.767
I must hurry to arrange
my marriage plans today.

28:44.167 --> 28:47.967
He wants to marry my Rosina!

28:48.300 --> 28:50.566
The doddering old fool!

28:51.401 --> 28:54.100
But who is this Don Basilio?

28:54.300 --> 28:59.900
A matchmaker and conniver,
without a penny or a conscience.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.233
Now he's Rosina's music teacher.

29:06.933 --> 29:10.633
Let Rosina know how you feel.

29:11.533 --> 29:16.733
Explain everything to her in a song.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.750
Here's my guitar.  Let's get started.

29:24.401 --> 29:26.100
Where's your courage?

29:26.367 --> 29:29.658
All right, I'll try.

29:35.134 --> 29:41.000
If you'd like to know my name...

29:43.533 --> 29:50.067
...listen to the song on my lips.

29:55.533 --> 30:00.000
I am Lindoro, the man who adores you.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.933
I am Lindoro, the man who adores you.

30:03.167 --> 30:06.800
I long to marry you.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.234
You are always in my thoughts...

30:34.167 --> 30:39.434
...from dawn to the dusk of day.

30:56.878 --> 31:00.000
Go on, my love.  Go on!

31:00.000 --> 31:01.551
Go on, my love.  Go on!

31:07.434 --> 31:08.333
I'm delirious!

31:08.433 --> 31:10.500
Lucky man!  Go on.

31:10.867 --> 31:17.633
Your loving, devoted Lindoro...

31:18.367 --> 31:24.200
...cannot offer you a fortune.

31:30.300 --> 31:37.067
I am not rich.
I have only my heart to give.

31:37.501 --> 31:44.067
A loving, faithful heart...

31:56.700 --> 32:00.000
I sigh for you alone...

32:00.000 --> 32:02.200
I sigh for you alone...

32:16.267 --> 32:21.267
...from dawn to the dusk of day.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.600
Your sincere and loving Rosina...

32:55.200 --> 32:58.034
...gives her heart to --

33:03.633 --> 33:05.801
Someone came into the room.

33:08.200 --> 33:12.267
I'm delirious with love!
I must see her!

33:13.900 --> 33:15.234
And you must help me!

33:15.333 --> 33:17.533
My, my!  What passion!

33:20.666 --> 33:23.467
Get me into that house today.

33:25.034 --> 33:28.001
Use your famous ingenuity!

33:28.666 --> 33:30.000
I'll do it...but not by today.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.700
I'll do it...but not by today.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.533
You'll be handsomely rewarded.

33:43.300 --> 33:46.633
You'll have gold...piles of it!

33:53.600 --> 33:56.401
What affection I feel...

33:57.800 --> 34:00.000
...when "Lindoro" mentions...

34:00.000 --> 34:01.967
...when "Lindoro" mentions...

34:02.666 --> 34:06.833
... that sweet word "gold."

34:08.300 --> 34:13.067
At the mere thought of that metal...

34:13.533 --> 34:18.366
...so miraculous and all-powerful...

34:23.000 --> 34:29.034
...a volcano of stupendous ideas
erupts in me!

34:59.234 --> 35:00.000
Let's see what this metal can do.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.533
Let's see what this metal can do.

35:05.733 --> 35:10.367
What surprising effect
will it have on you?

35:11.167 --> 35:17.566
What will the volcano
in your mind devise?

35:49.067 --> 35:51.467
You should disguise yourself.

35:56.867 --> 35:58.067
As a soldier!

36:00.434 --> 36:04.900
As a soldier?  Whatever for?

36:08.434 --> 36:11.401
A regiment is arriving today.

36:12.600 --> 36:16.334
I know.  The colonel is my friend.

36:18.367 --> 36:24.034
With orders to lodge in that house,
the door will open!

36:28.300 --> 36:30.000
Don't you think I've hit it?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.167
Don't you think I've hit it?

36:32.666 --> 36:36.067
What a stroke of genius!

36:37.767 --> 36:39.666
A great idea!

37:07.666 --> 37:10.600
I have another brainstorm.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.366
See what gold can do?

37:15.501 --> 37:18.933
You must pretend to be drunk!

37:27.200 --> 37:30.000
Drunk?  Whatever for?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.666
Drunk?  Whatever for?

37:37.034 --> 37:40.333
Picture a man who's not himself...

37:42.034 --> 37:43.933
...overcome by drink!

37:46.234 --> 37:50.167
The old man, believe me...

37:50.933 --> 37:55.600
...the old man will think you're harmless!

38:12.666 --> 38:16.134
What a stroke of genius!

38:16.234 --> 38:17.800
What a great idea!

38:41.833 --> 38:43.633
Now to work!

38:49.467 --> 38:53.666
Oh, I forgot the most important thing.

38:55.200 --> 38:59.867
Where's your shop?
Where will I find you?

39:00.533 --> 39:06.279
You can't miss my shop...it's right here!

39:12.933 --> 39:18.967
Number 15, marked on the side.
On wheels, so it can ride.

39:19.067 --> 39:22.034
Wigs of every possible shade.

39:22.267 --> 39:25.300
High-class, the finest grade.

39:25.533 --> 39:28.533
All in the most modern style...

39:28.700 --> 39:30.000
And all lit by lantern.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.501
And all lit by lantern.

39:31.767 --> 39:34.467
You'll find me here without fail.

39:44.667 --> 39:47.300
You'll find me here without fail.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.300
Wigs of every shade.
Look for the lantern.

39:51.467 --> 39:54.167
You'll find me here without fail.

39:57.967 --> 40:00.000
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll take care of it.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.167
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll take care of it.

40:08.900 --> 40:10.999
Bring lots of gold!

40:11.000 --> 40:14.500
Do well and your purse will swell.

40:17.434 --> 40:21.600
Never fear, all will go well.

40:22.867 --> 40:26.100
Ardor sets my heart tingling.

40:26.300 --> 40:29.401
I already hear gold jingling!

40:29.501 --> 40:30.000
I'm ablaze with love and hope.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.333
I'm ablaze with love and hope.

40:35.733 --> 40:39.767
I hear the sound of money
loud and clear!

40:45.900 --> 40:50.767
I can almost touch it!
My gold is almost here!

41:20.666 --> 41:23.600
- Number 15?
- On wheels.

41:23.900 --> 41:27.067
- With wigs?
- Very high-class!

41:27.167 --> 41:28.533
You'll be there?

41:28.833 --> 41:30.000
Without fail!

41:30.000 --> 41:30.267
Without fail!

41:39.800 --> 41:43.034
Ardor sets my heart tingling.

41:43.467 --> 41:46.666
I already hear gold jingling!

43:17.000 --> 43:26.034
The voice I just heard
has won my heart.

43:29.566 --> 43:30.000
My heart has been wounded by love...

43:30.000 --> 43:35.034
My heart has been wounded by love...

43:35.566 --> 43:42.234
...and Lindoro threw the dart.

43:45.167 --> 43:49.700
Yes, Lindoro shall be mine.

43:54.334 --> 43:57.467
I swear I'll win the day.

44:18.167 --> 44:22.300
My guardian won't consent.
But in the end, he'll relent.

44:23.067 --> 44:27.967
He'll give in to me
and I'll be happy at last.

44:31.533 --> 44:38.666
Lindoro shall be mine.

44:49.434 --> 44:52.566
I swear I'll win the day.

45:47.867 --> 45:55.367
I'm well-behaved.  Quite respectful.

45:57.501 --> 46:00.000
I'm obedient...

46:00.000 --> 46:01.967
I'm obedient...

46:03.000 --> 46:06.133
...sweet and loving.

46:06.134 --> 46:12.133
I can be ruled.  I can be guided.

46:19.767 --> 46:26.933
But if I'm crossed in love,
I can be a viper!

46:27.767 --> 46:30.000
And I'll play a hundred tricks
to get my way!

46:30.000 --> 46:34.767
And I'll play a hundred tricks
to get my way!

47:09.767 --> 47:14.733
I'm well-behaved...I'm obedient.

47:15.034 --> 47:18.067
I can be ruled.  I can be guided.

47:30.633 --> 47:37.733
But if I'm crossed in love...

47:37.833 --> 47:41.034
...I can be a viper.

47:41.867 --> 47:48.567
And I'll play a hundred tricks
to get my way!

49:21.600 --> 49:24.633
Yes, I'll win Lindoro.

49:25.633 --> 49:28.633
I need to send him this letter.
But how?

49:29.200 --> 49:30.000
My guardian has eyes
in the back of his head!

49:30.000 --> 49:32.334
My guardian has eyes
in the back of his head!

49:33.034 --> 49:37.567
Oh, well, I'll seal it anyway.

49:41.167 --> 49:45.134
I saw Figaro talking with my beloved.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.267
Figaro is clever and has a good heart.

49:53.833 --> 49:59.034
He'll be the perfect go-between.

50:07.466 --> 50:10.167
- What are you doing?
- Dying of boredom.

50:11.048 --> 50:14.500
What?  A spirited, beautiful girl like you?

50:19.300 --> 50:25.833
What good does that do me,
shut inside these four walls?

50:25.933 --> 50:29.967
I feel I'm buried in a tomb!

50:35.733 --> 50:38.800
My guardian's coming back!

50:39.566 --> 50:43.733
- I have something to tell you later.
- So do I, Figaro!

50:45.833 --> 50:48.067
How clever he is!

50:48.800 --> 50:51.000
Damn that Figaro!

50:52.501 --> 50:54.800
That no-good scoundrel!

50:55.000 --> 50:56.633
(Always shouting!)

50:59.367 --> 51:00.000
He's made my house a hospital...

51:00.000 --> 51:02.100
He's made my house a hospital...

51:02.566 --> 51:06.433
...with his potions and leeches...

51:08.000 --> 51:10.167
...and snuff!

51:14.134 --> 51:18.700
Signorina, have you seen the barber?

51:21.134 --> 51:23.467
I want to know!

51:23.633 --> 51:25.434
You're angry with him, too?

51:31.300 --> 51:38.300
Well, I enjoy seeing him.
He's so young and handsome.

51:39.365 --> 51:41.267
Choke on that, nasty man!

51:44.401 --> 51:49.267
What a delightful girl.
The more I love her...

51:49.367 --> 51:52.633
...the more she hates me, the vixen!.

51:53.700 --> 51:58.267
The barber must have 
turned her against me.

51:59.234 --> 52:00.000
What servants!  Two corpses!

52:00.000 --> 52:01.733
What servants!  Two corpses!

52:02.434 --> 52:04.434
The devil take you!

52:06.300 --> 52:10.367
Damned barber!  You'll pay for this!

52:11.566 --> 52:14.300
Don Basilio, you're just in time.

52:14.733 --> 52:18.700
Either by force, or out of love...

52:19.401 --> 52:24.600
...by tomorrow, I must marry my Rosina.

52:30.833 --> 52:34.733
That's exactly why I came to warn you.

52:36.334 --> 52:38.300
But in secret.

52:38.933 --> 52:42.800
Count Almaviva is in town.

52:42.900 --> 52:45.500
Rosina's secret admirer!

52:46.467 --> 52:49.467
This calls for quick action.

52:52.633 --> 52:54.700
Yes, but on the sly.

52:58.234 --> 53:00.000
We must invent a story
that disgraces the Count publicly.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.700
We must invent a story
that disgraces the Count publicly.

53:07.267 --> 53:12.234
He'll look like a criminal...

53:15.933 --> 53:18.700
...a lost soul.

53:21.533 --> 53:27.000
I'll ruin him within a week, believe me.

53:27.566 --> 53:30.000
We'll have him run out of town!

53:30.000 --> 53:32.733
We'll have him run out of town!

53:39.234 --> 53:43.533
I have a system that's - foolproof.

53:50.100 --> 53:51.633
Slander?

53:52.867 --> 53:56.867
Do you understand its power?

53:58.167 --> 54:00.000
No?  Then listen to me...

54:00.000 --> 54:00.767
No?  Then listen to me...

54:00.867 --> 54:04.600
...and be quiet.

54:16.329 --> 54:22.957
Slander is a little breeze.

54:25.633 --> 54:30.000
A mild wind...quite gentle.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.733
A mild wind...quite gentle.

54:34.800 --> 54:39.900
It's imperceptible and subtle...

54:41.633 --> 54:46.234
...light and sweet.

54:55.566 --> 54:58.100
It begins as a murmur.

55:00.167 --> 55:06.067
Softly...here and there...

55:08.700 --> 55:14.800
...it's a whisper...a hiss.

55:16.666 --> 55:20.566
It idles along.

55:20.900 --> 55:24.867
It rambles around.

55:25.034 --> 55:30.000
It manages to slide into people's ears.

55:30.000 --> 55:30.867
It manages to slide into people's ears.

55:31.466 --> 55:35.300
It slips inside their brains.

55:35.967 --> 55:40.000
Then it swells and it stuns.

55:46.367 --> 55:48.667
It comes out of the mouth...

55:50.167 --> 55:52.100
...with an ever louder noise.

55:54.034 --> 55:56.000
And gathering force...

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
...it flies from place to place.

56:00.000 --> 56:00.234
...it flies from place to place.

56:00.334 --> 56:07.433
Like thunder echoing through the forest,
it makes your blood run cold!

56:08.034 --> 56:13.666
Finally, it spreads
and produces an explosion.

56:15.267 --> 56:17.533
Like the roar of a cannon!

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
An earthquake!  A tempest!
Shaking the heavens and the seas!

56:30.000 --> 56:32.967
An earthquake!  A tempest!
Shaking the heavens and the seas!

56:48.034 --> 56:55.965
And what happens to the
 poor wretch, vilified by lies?

57:00.700 --> 57:06.067
The public crushes him until, with luck...

57:06.666 --> 57:09.167
...he dies!

57:21.800 --> 57:26.034
The public crushes him...

57:26.134 --> 57:30.000
...until, with luck, he dies!

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
...until, with luck, he dies!

58:22.867 --> 58:28.600
I want to do things my way.
Let's prepare the marriage contract.

58:32.533 --> 58:34.833
Once she's my wife...

58:35.067 --> 58:39.833
...I'll protect her from these rogues.

58:43.566 --> 58:48.200
(If there's money in it, count on me!)

58:52.666 --> 58:58.334
I heard everything.
That poor, foolish doctor.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.000
His "wife".  Don't make me laugh.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.367
His "wife".  Don't make me laugh.

59:03.401 --> 59:07.067
Now's a good time to talk to the girl.

59:10.767 --> 59:12.767
Great news, Signorina.

59:14.100 --> 59:17.566
- We'll be throwing rice soon.
- Meaning what?

59:19.600 --> 59:23.733
By tomorrow night, your guardian
plans to become...

59:24.933 --> 59:26.533
...your husband!

59:28.867 --> 59:30.000
He and Don Basilio are 
drawing up the contract now.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.500
He and Don Basilio are 
drawing up the contract now.

59:35.300 --> 59:37.466
He's mistaken.

59:37.666 --> 59:40.367
The old fool with have to deal with me!

59:45.666 --> 59:52.700
Were you talking with a 
gentleman under my window?

59:53.067 --> 59:57.067
He's my cousin.
A fine, warm-hearted young man.

59:57.167 --> 01:00:00.000
He's here to study and make his fortune.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.900
He's here to study and make his fortune.

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:10.533
Confidentially...

01:00:12.767 --> 01:00:15.067
...he has a great defect.

01:00:18.367 --> 01:00:20.501
He's dying of love!

01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:25.600
This young man interests me.

01:00:32.933 --> 01:00:35.800
Does his beloved live far away?

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.267
No, nearby.

01:00:40.566 --> 01:00:42.167
Two steps!

01:00:42.666 --> 01:00:49.267
- Is she pretty?
- Very!  I'll describe her.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.401
Shapely, lively, with red hair...

01:00:53.566 --> 01:01:00.000
...dancing eyes...and hands to die for!

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.566
...dancing eyes...and hands to die for!

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.201
You want to know her name, too?
A lovely name...

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.633
Dear girl, I'll spell it for you.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.300
So I'm the one!

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.367
You're not teasing me?

01:01:33.434 --> 01:01:36.434
Am I really the lucky one?

01:01:40.666 --> 01:01:47.467
I already guessed it.
I knew it before you did.

01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:53.101
You're not teasing me?

01:01:58.767 --> 01:02:00.000
I knew it before you did.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.401
I knew it before you did.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:16.367
You're the object of
Lindoro's love, sweet Rosina.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.167
(What a cunning little vixen!)

01:02:33.034 --> 01:02:36.733
(Still, she'll need my help!)

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.501
- How do I get to talk to him?
- Lindoro will be here very soon.

01:02:58.334 --> 01:03:00.000
Wonderful.  But we'll have 
to meet in secret.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.067
Wonderful.  But we'll have 
to meet in secret.

01:03:03.833 --> 01:03:08.267
I can't bear this delay.
What's keeping him?

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:16.167
The poor man is waiting
for a sign of affection from you.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.700
Write him two lines and he'll be here.

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.453
What do you say?

01:03:37.167 --> 01:03:38.406
I wouldn't dare.

01:03:41.967 --> 01:03:44.130
- Two lines...
- I'd be embarrassed!

01:03:48.034 --> 01:03:50.933
Hurry...a note!

01:03:55.234 --> 01:03:57.193
Here it is!

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.134
Already written?

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.201
I could take lessons from her!

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.967
Fortune smiles on my love.

01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:20.600
I can breathe easy again.

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:25.867
She could be a professor
in the art of love!

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.467
My life will be complete
only with my beloved.

01:04:36.234 --> 01:04:40.100
Only his love can console me.

01:04:47.234 --> 01:04:50.833
Women, women!  Bless them...

01:04:50.834 --> 01:04:54.267
Who ever knows what's on their minds?

01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:06.134
- When is Lindoro coming?
- He's on his way.

01:05:07.666 --> 01:05:10.633
- He'll be here soon.
- But in secret!

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:21.334
Fortune smiles on my love.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.933
I can breathe easy again.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.501
Women, women!  Bless them...

01:05:44.867 --> 01:05:48.434
But who ever knows
what's on their minds?

01:06:49.466 --> 01:06:51.900
I feel better now.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.100
That Figaro is a fine young man.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:06.134
My dear Rosina...
what brought him here this morning?

01:07:06.666 --> 01:07:08.767
Figaro?  I don't know.

01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:15.733
He talked about a hundred trifles...

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.267
...about French fashion...

01:07:19.334 --> 01:07:22.934
...and his daughter Marcellina's health.

01:07:29.167 --> 01:07:30.000
Why are you fingers stained with ink?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.833
Why are you fingers stained with ink?

01:07:35.367 --> 01:07:40.401
I burned them and 
used ink to cool them off!

01:07:43.467 --> 01:07:47.134
(Damn!)  And these papers?

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:54.034
There are five instead of six!

01:07:56.533 --> 01:07:59.500
I used one to wrap candy for Marcellina.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.967
And why did you sharpen the pen?

01:08:13.034 --> 01:08:19.133
To draw a flower for my embroidery.

01:08:33.367 --> 01:08:42.167
For a doctor of my standing,
your excuses aren't good enough.

01:08:47.867 --> 01:08:53.401
I advise you, my dear,
to think up something better.

01:09:22.767 --> 01:09:26.967
For a doctor of my standing,
your excuses aren't good enough.

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.000
I advise you to think up
something better!

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.200
I advise you to think up
something better!

01:09:50.434 --> 01:09:55.867
Sweets for Marcellina?
A design for your embroidery?

01:09:57.566 --> 01:10:00.000
You burned your finger?  Nonsense!

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.533
You burned your finger?  Nonsense!

01:10:03.334 --> 01:10:08.333
It would take much more to fool me.

01:10:21.401 --> 01:10:23.885
Why was that paper missing?

01:10:27.234 --> 01:10:28.500
You can't fool me.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.867
My child, don't try to deceive me.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:57.666
For a doctor of my standing,
your excuses aren't good enough.

01:10:57.967 --> 01:11:00.000
I advise you, my dear, 
to think up something better.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.667
I advise you, my dear, 
to think up something better.

01:11:14.633 --> 01:11:17.666
Come now, dear child, confess.

01:11:21.167 --> 01:11:24.800
I'm ready to forgive you.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.000
No answer?  You're stubborn?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.234
No answer?  You're stubborn?

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:43.733
Well, I know exactly what to do!

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.167
Whenever I leave the house,
I'll lock you inside!

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.867
Pouting won't help you.

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:21.700
I'll lock up so tightly
even air won't get inside!

01:12:23.666 --> 01:12:25.767
Innocent little Rosina...

01:12:27.167 --> 01:12:29.267
...can cry her heart out.

01:12:29.566 --> 01:12:30.000
I'll lock up so tightly
even air won't get inside!

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.967
I'll lock up so tightly
even air won't get inside!

01:12:50.067 --> 01:12:53.400
You'll be locked up as long as I see fit!

01:13:02.467 --> 01:13:07.900
When I go out, the servants
will see that you're locked inside!

01:13:16.367 --> 01:13:20.300
Pouting won't help you!  Not one bit!

01:13:21.733 --> 01:13:25.401
I'll lock up so tightly
even air won't get inside.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.000
A doctor of my standing
isn't so easily fooled.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.367
A doctor of my standing
isn't so easily fooled.

01:13:45.134 --> 01:13:47.700
Little Rosina can cry her eyes out.

01:13:49.067 --> 01:13:53.567
I'll lock you in your room
until kingdom come!

01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:44.367
I thought I heard a murmur in there.

01:14:45.434 --> 01:14:50.067
Must be the doctor with his ward.
He never has a moment's peace.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.533
Oh, these modern girls!

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.600
Open up!

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:08.100
This snuff will land me in my grave.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.000
Anybody home, good people?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.067
Anybody home, good people?

01:15:38.666 --> 01:15:44.234
Anybody home?  Don't you hear me?

01:15:49.234 --> 01:15:52.134
What an ugly face.  And drunk, too!

01:15:55.933 --> 01:15:57.567
Anybody home?

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:02.067
Curse you all!

01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:05.767
What's your business, Mr. Soldier?

01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:12.667
He has no reason to be here.

01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:17.234
Are you -- wait a minute...

01:16:18.933 --> 01:16:21.667
Are you Dr. Bad-breath?

01:16:24.934 --> 01:16:26.900
Ah...Dr. Big-belly?

01:16:30.134 --> 01:16:32.267
Go to the devil!

01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:36.700
Dr. Bartolo!

01:16:42.134 --> 01:16:45.134
Wonderful...Dr. Barbarian!

01:16:52.367 --> 01:16:55.666
I knew I had it right!

01:16:56.433 --> 01:16:58.633
I'm losing my patience.

01:17:03.566 --> 01:17:05.833
(Where can Rosina be?)

01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:15.167
So you're a doctor?

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.800
Wonderful!  Embrace me!

01:17:21.967 --> 01:17:23.767
We're colleagues!

01:17:31.167 --> 01:17:33.600
I'm a doctor, too.

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.833
I'm the veterinarian!

01:17:40.267 --> 01:17:44.933
Here are my orders to lodge here.

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:55.267
(Where can my darling be?)

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.501
(Where is my beloved?)

01:18:02.267 --> 01:18:05.333
A soldier?  With my guardian?

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.900
(It's Rosina!  What joy!)

01:18:29.467 --> 01:18:30.000
(I'm Lindoro!)

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.167
(I'm Lindoro!)

01:18:31.267 --> 01:18:33.666
(Be careful, for heaven's sake!)

01:18:34.334 --> 01:18:37.900
Signorina, leave the room at once!

01:18:46.267 --> 01:18:49.867
I'll go with her....a girl in my barracks!

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.000
You can't lodge here!

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:00.566
You can't lodge here!

01:19:01.633 --> 01:19:04.700
I have an exemption!

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:18.467
(In case I can't stay, take this note.)

01:19:22.067 --> 01:19:23.366
Where is it?

01:19:26.433 --> 01:19:28.201
I'll find it!

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.000
(I love you so!)

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:30.566
(I love you so!)

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:36.034
(My love for you is overwhelming!)

01:19:54.101 --> 01:19:57.199
"...in respect to lodging troops..."

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.000
"...Dr. Bartolo, etc....has an exemption!"

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.600
"...Dr. Bartolo, etc....has an exemption!"

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.733
Dr. Donkey, I'm lodging here!

01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:21.167
If you insist, I'll have you thrown out!

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
So you want to fight?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:30.200
So you want to fight?

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.501
I'll give you a fight!

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.633
A battle's great fun!

01:20:43.566 --> 01:20:45.234
That's the trench.

01:20:45.566 --> 01:20:48.000
You're the enemy.

01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:53.900
(Drop your handkerchief!)

01:21:06.367 --> 01:21:09.167
It may be a prescription.

01:21:11.501 --> 01:21:14.134
No, it's just a note.

01:21:14.566 --> 01:21:18.867
And it's my duty to deliver it.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.467
Give me that letter!

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.034
You want this note?

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:47.733
I dropped it by accident.

01:21:49.967 --> 01:21:52.401
It's only a laundry list.

01:22:04.267 --> 01:22:07.533
I was wrong.  It is a laundry list!

01:22:14.367 --> 01:22:16.100
I'm all befuddled.

01:22:16.367 --> 01:22:19.234
(He fell right into our trap!)

01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:27.134
(The old fool is bewildered.
He fell into your trap!)

01:22:53.533 --> 01:22:56.134
Always the same old story...

01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.000
...I'm always oppressed and mistreated.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.034
...I'm always oppressed and mistreated.

01:23:01.666 --> 01:23:03.933
What a horrible life!

01:23:04.334 --> 01:23:08.633
I can't bear it any longer!

01:23:14.067 --> 01:23:15.466
Get out!

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.067
Stop this!

01:23:40.533 --> 01:23:42.533
What's going on here?

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:50.000
This uproar has attracted half the city!

01:23:55.933 --> 01:24:00.000
(Sir, be careful, for pity's sake.)

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.134
That criminal!

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:10.134
Soldier, I'll have to 
teach you some manners!

01:24:12.867 --> 01:24:17.600
(Sir, be careful, for pity's sake!)

01:24:18.934 --> 01:24:20.301
You ugly baboon!

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.200
You lowlife!

01:24:24.533 --> 01:24:25.933
I'll shout him down!

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.467
I'll kill him!

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:34.167
I'll kill him without mercy!

01:24:43.501 --> 01:24:45.300
Quiet, someone's knocking.

01:24:47.767 --> 01:24:49.334
What's going on?

01:24:50.533 --> 01:24:52.588
Who is it?

01:24:54.267 --> 01:24:58.067
Open up, in the name of the law!

01:25:01.633 --> 01:25:04.200
The police!

01:25:05.234 --> 01:25:07.967
Oh, damn it all!

01:25:09.134 --> 01:25:12.333
- Now you're in for it.
- Don't worry.

01:25:15.767 --> 01:25:20.367
I hope we survive this adventure.

01:25:41.034 --> 01:25:44.267
Stay where you are.  No one move.

01:25:48.533 --> 01:25:51.767
What caused this disturbance?

01:25:57.867 --> 01:26:00.000
This drunken soldier attacked me, sir!

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.600
This drunken soldier attacked me, sir!

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.267
I only came to calm them, sir!

01:26:05.566 --> 01:26:07.867
He threatened to kill us, sir!

01:26:09.167 --> 01:26:13.200
He wouldn't let me lodge here, sir!

01:26:24.934 --> 01:26:26.900
I understand!

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
My good man, you're under arrest!

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.267
My good man, you're under arrest!

01:26:39.733 --> 01:26:41.467
I'm under arrest?

01:26:47.367 --> 01:26:50.600
Just have a look at this!

01:27:15.034 --> 01:27:24.300
I'm frozen and motionless,
just like a statue.

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:30.000
I've had the wind knocked out of me.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.134
I've had the wind knocked out of me.

01:27:33.833 --> 01:27:38.067
I can't even breathe.

01:27:41.533 --> 01:27:47.234
I'm frozen and motionless...

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:52.833
...just like a statue.

01:28:38.134 --> 01:28:40.501
Look at Dr. Bartolo!

01:28:42.666 --> 01:28:44.933
He's like a statue!

01:28:57.267 --> 01:28:59.167
Look at Dr. Bartolo!

01:29:10.533 --> 01:29:12.467
Look at Dr. Bartolo!

01:29:17.501 --> 01:29:19.867
He's just like a statue.

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.340
Oh, I could die laughing!

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:30.000
Just look at Dr. Bartolo.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.800
Just look at Dr. Bartolo.

01:29:37.234 --> 01:29:39.300
I can't even breathe.

01:29:43.134 --> 01:29:45.933
I could die laughing!

01:30:14.633 --> 01:30:17.800
But sir...I protest...I request....

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:26.101
Quiet!  Everyone go about his business.

01:30:42.466 --> 01:30:45.814
My head feels as if it were hammered...

01:30:46.415 --> 01:30:49.995
...on a horrible anvil!

01:30:58.424 --> 01:31:00.000
The blows come faster.
They never stop.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.417
The blows come faster.
They never stop.

01:31:12.075 --> 01:31:16.039
Up and down, high and low...

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.917
...blow after blow!

01:31:36.482 --> 01:31:43.677
What a racket!  The walls are shaking!

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.559
The very foundation is breaking!

01:31:59.887 --> 01:32:00.000
My poor head!  My battered brain!

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.999
My poor head!  My battered brain!

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.561
If this goes on, I'll go insane!

01:32:07.666 --> 01:32:09.224
My poor head...

01:32:11.619 --> 01:32:13.455
...my battered brain!

01:32:16.016 --> 01:32:18.898
If this goes on, I'll go insane!

01:32:24.902 --> 01:32:30.000
My head feels as if 
it were hammered on a horrible anvil.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.420
My head feels as if 
it were hammered on a horrible anvil.

01:32:40.738 --> 01:32:44.268
The noise never ceases,
it only increases.

01:33:20.987 --> 01:33:24.578
This could drive us all insane.

01:38:45.295 --> 01:38:47.955
What bad luck!

01:38:49.288 --> 01:38:56.355
No one in the whole regiment
knows that soldier.

01:39:04.556 --> 01:39:11.755
I bet Count Almaviva sent him
to woo Rosina of his behalf.

01:39:12.722 --> 01:39:16.422
A man's not safe even in his own house!

01:39:19.123 --> 01:39:20.522
Who's knocking?

01:39:23.522 --> 01:39:27.023
Go open the door!  I'm home...

01:39:27.123 --> 01:39:30.000
...so don't be afraid to answer.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.789
...so don't be afraid to answer.

01:39:42.222 --> 01:39:46.455
Peace and joy be with you.

01:39:47.155 --> 01:39:50.522
A thousand thanks.  You're very kind.

01:39:50.922 --> 01:39:55.522
Joy and peace for a thousand years.

01:40:13.056 --> 01:40:16.123
I'm truly honored.

01:40:16.288 --> 01:40:19.322
(I've seen him before, but where?)

01:40:19.422 --> 01:40:20.656
(He doesn't recognize me.)

01:40:24.322 --> 01:40:26.989
(This time, I'll be successful!)

01:40:34.355 --> 01:40:37.722
Joy and peace.  Peace and joy.

01:40:40.422 --> 01:40:42.288
(What a bore!)

01:40:48.789 --> 01:40:51.288
Stop it!  That's enough!

01:41:09.009 --> 01:41:10.421
(The old fool doesn't recognize me!)

01:41:10.422 --> 01:41:12.522
- (What a disaster!)
- (What luck!)

01:41:13.689 --> 01:41:18.956
(Soon my love and I
will be alone together.)

01:41:26.455 --> 01:41:29.188
(I'll free my beloved!)

01:41:29.288 --> 01:41:30.000
(Fate is against me!)

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.389
(Fate is against me!)

01:42:13.555 --> 01:42:15.756
In short, Sir...

01:42:16.222 --> 01:42:18.222
...who are you anyway?

01:42:18.522 --> 01:42:22.622
Don Alonso, music teacher.

01:42:22.722 --> 01:42:25.555
A pupil of Don Basilio.

01:42:31.756 --> 01:42:35.288
Don Basilio is ill today.
He sent me instead.

01:42:39.056 --> 01:42:41.455
It's not a serious illness.

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:45.322
(I don't trust this fellow.)

01:42:49.822 --> 01:42:51.856
Speak louder!

01:42:53.722 --> 01:42:59.056
I'm Don Alonso!
I just came from Count Almaviva!

01:42:59.155 --> 01:43:00.000
Not so loud!

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.889
Not so loud!

01:43:09.322 --> 01:43:16.656
I met the Count this morning at my inn.

01:43:16.756 --> 01:43:21.023
He dropped this note,
sent to him by your Rosina.

01:43:22.856 --> 01:43:25.222
Her handwriting!

01:43:25.389 --> 01:43:28.522
Don Basilio knows nothing of this.

01:43:28.622 --> 01:43:30.000
I'm here to give the 
young lady a singing lesson.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.656
I'm here to give the 
young lady a singing lesson.

01:43:46.123 --> 01:43:49.222
If you'd let me see the young lady...

01:43:50.255 --> 01:43:57.322
...I'd tell her the Count's mistress
gave me this note.

01:43:57.522 --> 01:44:00.000
Proof that the Count
is only toying with Rosina!

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.322
Proof that the Count
is only toying with Rosina!

01:44:07.522 --> 01:44:10.155
Slander?

01:44:11.522 --> 01:44:15.288
You are indeed a pupil of Don Basilio!

01:44:15.489 --> 01:44:19.689
I'll reward you for this suggestion.

01:44:20.422 --> 01:44:22.822
I'll call the girl.

01:44:25.188 --> 01:44:30.000
Since you're obviously a friend,
I'll trust you.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:30.322
Since you're obviously a friend,
I'll trust you.

01:44:36.656 --> 01:44:39.955
(I never meant to 
show him Rosina's note.)

01:44:40.355 --> 01:44:45.989
(But without some trick,
I'd have to leave like a fool.)

01:44:47.555 --> 01:44:53.255
(I'll tell her my plan.
If she agrees, I'll be a happy man.)

01:44:54.656 --> 01:44:56.155
(Here she is.)

01:44:56.188 --> 01:44:59.622
(How my heart is pounding!)

01:45:03.789 --> 01:45:07.188
Here's Don Alonso,
your new music teacher.

01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:12.789
I have a cramp in my foot.

01:45:14.756 --> 01:45:18.589
Come sit by me, lovely child.

01:45:18.789 --> 01:45:24.656
If you don't mind, 
I'll substitute for Don Basilio today.

01:45:25.355 --> 01:45:29.822
I couldn't be more delighted!

01:45:31.756 --> 01:45:38.589
I'll sing the rondo from
"The Useless Precaution."

01:46:35.123 --> 01:46:40.123
Against a heart inflamed with love...

01:46:48.422 --> 01:46:52.522
...burning with the unquenchable fire...

01:46:54.056 --> 01:46:57.288
...of fiery love...

01:47:12.455 --> 01:47:17.956
...a ruthless tyrant cruelly wages war.

01:47:21.689 --> 01:47:27.355
But love always triumphs!

01:48:04.222 --> 01:48:07.522
My darling, how I'm suffering!

01:48:08.689 --> 01:48:12.389
How my guardian enrages me!

01:48:13.789 --> 01:48:20.623
Dearest, I'm counting 
on you to save me.

01:48:25.989 --> 01:48:30.000
Dearest, I put all my trust in you.
Save me!

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.822
Dearest, I put all my trust in you.
Save me!

01:48:36.922 --> 01:48:41.056
Don't worry, I'll save you.

01:48:42.288 --> 01:48:46.089
Fortune will smile on us.

01:48:46.188 --> 01:48:51.523
- Then I can hope?
- You'll soon rejoice!

01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:26.822
What a beautiful vision of love.

01:49:31.923 --> 01:49:38.255
What a lovely vision of happiness.

01:49:42.789 --> 01:49:46.322
You set my heart on fire.

01:49:49.389 --> 01:49:53.522
My heart is pounding with joy.

01:49:54.322 --> 01:49:58.322
You make me delirious with love.

01:50:06.822 --> 01:50:10.989
What a beautiful vision of love.

01:50:15.322 --> 01:50:20.288
A lovely vision of happiness.

01:50:35.023 --> 01:50:37.089
Have no fear.

01:50:38.089 --> 01:50:40.222
Trust in me.

01:50:41.989 --> 01:50:46.822
Fortune will smile on us.

01:50:47.288 --> 01:50:50.622
- Then I can hope?
- Trust in me.

01:50:52.422 --> 01:50:54.622
You'll soon rejoice!

01:51:18.822 --> 01:51:22.355
What a happy vision of love!

01:51:26.288 --> 01:51:29.656
You set my heart on fire.

01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:36.355
My heart is pounding with love.

01:52:26.856 --> 01:52:30.000
Dearest, I put all my trust in you.
Save me, for pity's sake!

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.989
Dearest, I put all my trust in you.
Save me, for pity's sake!

01:53:37.322 --> 01:53:38.989
A beautiful voice!

01:53:43.355 --> 01:53:46.056
Yes, a beautiful voice...

01:53:46.288 --> 01:53:49.589
...but this modern aria is so boring.

01:53:52.089 --> 01:53:55.656
In my day, music was music.

01:53:57.288 --> 01:54:00.000
For example, that old aria
sung by...Caffariello.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.989
For example, that old aria
sung by...Caffariello.

01:54:25.155 --> 01:54:29.555
When my love is near...

01:54:30.123 --> 01:54:35.288
...my sweetest Rosina...

01:54:36.656 --> 01:54:42.023
The area says "Giannina"
but I changed it to...

01:54:47.422 --> 01:54:50.027
When my love is near...

01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:56.422
...my sweetest Rosina...

01:55:00.522 --> 01:55:03.056
...my heart dances a minuet!

01:55:13.489 --> 01:55:15.956
Very funny, Mr. Barber!

01:55:21.155 --> 01:55:23.656
It was a moment of weakness.

01:55:28.023 --> 01:55:30.000
I've come to shave you.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.188
I've come to shave you.

01:55:31.288 --> 01:55:35.056
- No, not today.
- I can't come tomorrow.

01:55:35.889 --> 01:55:39.555
I'm busy with 
the officers of the regiment.

01:55:39.656 --> 01:55:42.089
Then wigs for Countess Andronica...

01:55:42.188 --> 01:55:45.288
...and hair to curl for Count Bombe.

01:55:45.289 --> 01:55:51.356
Then an enema 
for the mayor's indigestion.

01:55:56.288 --> 01:56:00.000
I don't want a shave today.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:00.056
I don't want a shave today.

01:56:01.222 --> 01:56:03.822
What a customer!

01:56:03.956 --> 01:56:08.722
This morning, I find a madhouse here.
Now, nothing doing!

01:56:09.188 --> 01:56:12.622
I'm busy!  I'm no country barber!

01:56:12.722 --> 01:56:15.455
Find yourself somebody else!

01:56:15.922 --> 01:56:18.622
Fine, have it your way.

01:56:19.023 --> 01:56:21.023
Such airs!

01:56:22.822 --> 01:56:24.722
Get a clean towel.

01:56:25.155 --> 01:56:28.089
No, I'll go myself.

01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:30.000
(If only I had those keys...!)

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.422
(If only I had those keys...!)

01:56:33.289 --> 01:56:38.821
- One key opens the balcony window?
- Yes, the newest one.

01:56:38.822 --> 01:56:43.288
I shouldn't leave her
with that damned barber.

01:56:47.123 --> 01:56:50.522
Above the wardrobe,
you'll find all you need.

01:56:51.489 --> 01:56:54.756
Careful!  Don't touch anything!

01:56:54.956 --> 01:56:56.889
I'm not crazy.

01:56:59.656 --> 01:57:00.000
I'm going.  (What luck!)

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.889
I'm going.  (What luck!)

01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:28.022
It was Figaro who gave 
the Count Rosina's letter.

01:57:28.555 --> 01:57:30.000
- He looks like a real troublemaker.
- I can handle him!

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.489
- He looks like a real troublemaker.
- I can handle him!

01:57:49.389 --> 01:57:51.522
That clumsy oaf!

01:57:53.923 --> 01:57:55.723
Figaro is a genius!

01:57:56.189 --> 01:58:00.000
We're alone now, dearest.
Will you trust you future to me?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.289
We're alone now, dearest.
Will you trust you future to me?

01:58:11.355 --> 01:58:16.489
He broke six plates, 
eight glasses, and a chamber pot!

01:58:18.622 --> 01:58:20.014
(I got the key!)

01:58:20.756 --> 01:58:21.922
(We're in luck!)

01:58:23.756 --> 01:58:30.000
I almost killed myself in that hallway.
You keep every room dark!

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:30.722
I almost killed myself in that hallway.
You keep every room dark!

01:58:44.789 --> 01:58:46.156
Why is he here?

01:58:48.355 --> 01:58:50.322
You're here?

01:58:51.522 --> 01:58:58.288
I am at your service, one and all.

01:59:02.255 --> 01:59:06.155
What's this new turn of events?

01:59:09.555 --> 01:59:13.056
(We need a plan!)

01:59:13.422 --> 01:59:17.355
Don Basilio, how are you feeling?

01:59:19.023 --> 01:59:23.288
Why are we waiting?
Do I shave you or not?

01:59:36.522 --> 01:59:38.055
And the notary...?

01:59:42.355 --> 01:59:46.055
I explained everything
to the notary myself.

01:59:55.455 --> 01:59:57.656
Dr. Bartolo, explain --

01:59:57.756 --> 02:00:00.000
Doctor, may I have a word?

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:00.823
Doctor, may I have a word?

02:00:01.123 --> 02:00:04.288
Don Basilio, I'll be right with you.

02:00:11.789 --> 02:00:15.289
(Get rid of him or he'll give us away.)

02:00:19.322 --> 02:00:22.956
(He doesn't know 
anything about the letter.)

02:00:23.056 --> 02:00:26.556
(Someone's going on here,
but I don't know what.)

02:00:28.255 --> 02:00:30.000
(I'm afraid he'll reveal our secret.)

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.956
(I'm afraid he'll reveal our secret.)

02:00:49.188 --> 02:00:51.989
You have a fever, Don Basilio.

02:00:53.455 --> 02:00:57.856
Who told you to go out with a fever?

02:01:00.722 --> 02:01:02.189
I have a fever?

02:01:05.056 --> 02:01:08.222
You're yellow!

02:01:09.689 --> 02:01:12.989
Like a corpse!

02:01:14.355 --> 02:01:17.622
I'm yellow?

02:01:19.056 --> 02:01:22.789
Like a corpse?

02:01:26.756 --> 02:01:29.155
You're shaking all over!

02:01:35.155 --> 02:01:38.656
You've got scarlet fever!

02:01:42.789 --> 02:01:46.289
Go get some medicine.

02:01:50.288 --> 02:01:53.455
Get medicine.  Don't ruin your health.

02:01:53.889 --> 02:01:57.455
- Quick, to bed!
- I'm worried about you!

02:02:02.155 --> 02:02:06.222
Quick, go home to bed!

02:02:08.222 --> 02:02:10.222
(He gave me a purse...)

02:02:12.155 --> 02:02:14.789
(...to go home to bed.)

02:02:19.023 --> 02:02:22.522
(Well, as long as they all agree!)

02:02:26.455 --> 02:02:30.000
I'm not deaf!

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:30.722
I'm not deaf!

02:02:35.856 --> 02:02:39.555
You don't have to beg me.

02:02:39.756 --> 02:02:42.622
What a sickly complexion!

02:02:45.889 --> 02:02:48.522
A sickly complexion?

02:02:54.389 --> 02:02:57.756
Well, then, I'm leaving.

02:03:08.722 --> 02:03:12.255
Good evening, good sir.

02:03:19.956 --> 02:03:22.789
Leave as quickly as you can!

02:04:01.355 --> 02:04:07.722
Good evening, my friends.
We'll talk tomorrow.

02:04:08.023 --> 02:04:13.188
(Was there ever a more annoying pest?)

02:04:50.422 --> 02:04:53.656
Good evening once again!

02:05:07.489 --> 02:05:09.155
Ready, Dr. Bartolo?

02:05:21.856 --> 02:05:22.789
Tighter...

02:05:33.089 --> 02:05:35.956
(Rosina dear, listen carefully.)

02:05:39.622 --> 02:05:42.355
Tell me.  I'm all ears.

02:05:50.188 --> 02:05:57.089
At the stroke of midnight,
we'll come for you.

02:06:01.089 --> 02:06:07.956
Now that we have the key,
there's nothing to worry about.

02:06:24.322 --> 02:06:26.589
Something's in my eye.

02:06:30.222 --> 02:06:32.789
Just blow it out.

02:06:42.689 --> 02:06:47.756
At midnight, my love,
I'll be waiting for you.

02:07:09.123 --> 02:07:13.789
Dear, I must explain about your letter.

02:07:13.923 --> 02:07:17.722
I needed it for my disguise.

02:07:18.122 --> 02:07:19.855
Your disguise?

02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:24.555
So you're not Don Alonso!

02:07:26.555 --> 02:07:29.122
"Peace and joy..."  You imposter!

02:07:32.956 --> 02:07:37.922
Wretches!  You'll bring me
to an early death!

02:07:40.489 --> 02:07:42.622
Your head is spinning.

02:07:44.455 --> 02:07:47.789
Calm down, or you'll have a stroke!

02:09:20.088 --> 02:09:24.855
That suspicious old man...
let him yell till he drops dead.

02:09:25.822 --> 02:09:30.000
They're always shouting
 and fighting in this house.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.355
They're always shouting
 and fighting in this house.

02:09:35.255 --> 02:09:39.855
Never any peace
with that grumbling old man.

02:09:43.123 --> 02:09:46.422
What a madhouse!

02:10:17.622 --> 02:10:22.122
The girl wants a husband.
The old man wants a bride.

02:10:22.522 --> 02:10:27.022
One is mad, the other insane.
They're both fit to be tied.

02:10:58.856 --> 02:11:00.000
Is this what love can do?

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.622
Is this what love can do?

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:06.522
Drive you out of your mind?

02:11:17.622 --> 02:11:24.155
It's a universal evil, a mania, a twitch.

02:11:24.355 --> 02:11:28.455
It's a tickle and a torment.

02:11:30.255 --> 02:11:35.123
Poor me!  Even I feel it now!

02:11:40.756 --> 02:11:45.123
I feel it, too,
and I don't know how to escape!

02:11:54.255 --> 02:11:58.622
Cursed old age!  Everyone despises me.

02:11:58.856 --> 02:12:00.000
I'm a hopeless old maid
and I'll die in despair.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.555
I'm a hopeless old maid
and I'll die in despair.

02:13:21.522 --> 02:13:24.856
So you don't know this Don Alonso?

02:13:25.889 --> 02:13:30.000
The Count sent him.
They're plotting something.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.288
The Count sent him.
They're plotting something.

02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:35.222
I think he's the Count in person.

02:13:36.789 --> 02:13:38.689
(The purse proves it.)

02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:48.722
Get the notary.
Here's the front door key...hurry!.

02:13:49.056 --> 02:13:52.255
I'll be quick as a fox!

02:13:54.288 --> 02:13:59.422
Whether she likes it or not,
Rosina will marry me.

02:14:02.856 --> 02:14:05.222
I have a better idea.

02:14:12.989 --> 02:14:19.756
Your young man is toying with you.
He has another lover.

02:14:20.789 --> 02:14:22.656
Here's the proof.

02:14:33.023 --> 02:14:39.689
He and the barber are plotting again you.
Don't trust them.

02:14:40.555 --> 02:14:46.823
They want to deliver you
into Count Almaviva's arms.

02:14:47.722 --> 02:14:52.322
(Into the arms of a stranger....)

02:14:56.656 --> 02:15:00.000
(Ah, Lindoro...the traitor!)

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.489
(Ah, Lindoro...the traitor!)

02:15:02.856 --> 02:15:09.322
(Revenge!  Rosina will show
that liar a thing or two. )

02:15:13.355 --> 02:15:17.518
Do you still want to marry me?

02:15:22.522 --> 02:15:24.989
I certainly do.

02:15:26.355 --> 02:15:27.956
So be it.

02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:34.956
Let us be married at once.

02:15:35.422 --> 02:15:43.989
At midnight, that wretch will be here
with Figaro.  We were going to elope.

02:15:44.522 --> 02:15:47.389
Hurry, we must lock the door.

02:15:48.856 --> 02:15:53.822
They're coming through the balcony.
They have the key.

02:15:59.856 --> 02:16:00.000
Lock yourself in...I'll be right back.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.489
Lock yourself in...I'll be right back.

02:16:15.889 --> 02:16:22.555
How cruel fate is to me!

02:19:11.889 --> 02:19:14.056
We're here at last.

02:19:14.155 --> 02:19:16.355
Figaro, give me a hand.

02:19:20.123 --> 02:19:22.856
What hellish weather!

02:19:22.956 --> 02:19:24.689
A night for lovers!

02:19:25.455 --> 02:19:29.622
Give me some light.  Where is Rosina?

02:19:33.455 --> 02:19:37.689
- Oh, my love!
- Leave, you wretch!

02:19:38.023 --> 02:19:42.023
I was a fool to believe you.

02:19:42.889 --> 02:19:47.288
I'm here only to show you...

02:19:47.489 --> 02:19:50.656
...what a woman you've lost!

02:19:50.756 --> 02:19:54.022
You unworthy, two-faced liar!

02:19:54.622 --> 02:19:58.555
- I'm speechless!
- I don't understand!

02:20:03.756 --> 02:20:11.522
You only pretended to love me
to deliver me to vile Count Almaviva.

02:20:14.589 --> 02:20:19.056
Oh, you've been deceived, my darling.

02:20:19.422 --> 02:20:23.123
I am Count Almaviva...

02:20:23.455 --> 02:20:26.288
...not Lindoro!

02:20:37.056 --> 02:20:42.822
Am I waking...or am I dreaming?

02:20:46.089 --> 02:20:53.905
Is it really true?  Heaven, how I feel!

02:20:56.322 --> 02:21:00.000
I'm astonished...and delighted.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.789
I'm astonished...and delighted.

02:21:09.422 --> 02:21:13.656
I'm delirious with joy.

02:21:23.689 --> 02:21:28.123
They're beside themselves,
as pleased as they can be.

02:21:28.288 --> 02:21:30.000
How talented I am.
All this is because of me!

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:33.389
How talented I am.
All this is because of me!

02:21:36.188 --> 02:21:39.555
What a triumph!

02:21:40.023 --> 02:21:43.389
And so unexpected.

02:21:45.022 --> 02:21:50.789
What a happy, blessed moment.

02:21:55.589 --> 02:21:59.622
What a joyful love.

02:22:09.123 --> 02:22:14.856
I'm delirious with happiness.

02:22:24.222 --> 02:22:28.656
They're beside themselves...

02:22:29.089 --> 02:22:30.000
...as pleased as they can be.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.555
...as pleased as they can be.

02:22:41.255 --> 02:22:44.856
How talented I am.

02:22:45.789 --> 02:22:48.955
All this is because of me!

02:22:55.756 --> 02:23:00.000
My Lord...but...you...

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:00.455
My Lord...but...you...

02:23:02.756 --> 02:23:07.622
You are my only love...

02:23:07.989 --> 02:23:11.289
...and now you will be my blessed wife.

02:23:15.322 --> 02:23:22.023
Your blessed wife?
Oh, how my heart rejoices!

02:23:22.956 --> 02:23:25.656
Then you are happy?

02:23:26.322 --> 02:23:30.000
Oh, my Lord...my dearest!

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.689
Oh, my Lord...my dearest!

02:23:39.756 --> 02:23:43.322
What a sweet love knot.

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:55.023
All my sorrows are past.

02:23:55.255 --> 02:23:56.722
Let's leave!

02:24:02.756 --> 02:24:06.722
What a sweet love knot.

02:24:09.789 --> 02:24:12.155
Quick!  Let's get away!

02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:18.355
All our sorrows are past.

02:24:23.789 --> 02:24:28.322
Love has put an end to all my pain.

02:24:39.322 --> 02:24:41.956
Let's go, for heaven's sake!

02:24:52.288 --> 02:24:56.255
If you delay, our plans will be ruined!

02:25:13.656 --> 02:25:18.255
Two people with
 a lantern are at the door!

02:25:19.856 --> 02:25:22.789
What'll we do now?

02:25:28.422 --> 02:25:30.000
What'll we do?

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:30.989
What'll we do?

02:25:34.123 --> 02:25:40.656
Be quiet, be calm.  We'll just go to
the balcony and climb down the ladder.

02:25:42.856 --> 02:25:48.056
We'll just go to the balcony
and climb down the ladder.

02:26:59.322 --> 02:27:00.000
We're in real trouble now!

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.622
We're in real trouble now!

02:27:02.222 --> 02:27:04.756
The ladder is gone!

02:27:05.489 --> 02:27:06.989
Someone took it!

02:27:07.089 --> 02:27:09.555
What a disaster!

02:27:09.656 --> 02:27:13.322
Quiet, I hear people!
What'll we do now?

02:27:24.656 --> 02:27:28.889
It's Don Basilio...with our notary.

02:27:28.989 --> 02:27:30.000
Don't worry, leave everything to me.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.622
Don't worry, leave everything to me.

02:27:31.822 --> 02:27:39.188
Notary, you were arranging a marriage
between my niece and Count Almaviva.

02:27:41.622 --> 02:27:45.555
Here's the couple.
Are the papers ready?

02:27:47.123 --> 02:27:49.722
Wait.  Where's Dr. Bartolo?

02:27:55.288 --> 02:27:57.288
Take this ring...

02:28:02.522 --> 02:28:05.789
...or get two bullets in your head!

02:28:10.123 --> 02:28:11.722
I'll take the ring!

02:28:14.622 --> 02:28:19.922
With Figaro and Don Basilio
as our witnesses...she is my bride!

02:28:20.822 --> 02:28:24.522
- What happiness!
- I'm overwhelmed!

02:28:27.123 --> 02:28:29.456
Officer, there are the thieves!

02:28:33.589 --> 02:28:36.023
Arrest them!

02:28:36.322 --> 02:28:38.889
Sir, your name?

02:28:39.089 --> 02:28:41.756
My name is an honorable one.

02:28:42.756 --> 02:28:45.223
I am Count Almaviva.

02:28:50.555 --> 02:28:53.889
The Count?  What do I hear?

02:28:55.722 --> 02:29:00.000
Silence!  Give up once and for all.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:00.282
Silence!  Give up once and for all.

02:29:03.489 --> 02:29:06.789
I'm putting an end to your cruelty.

02:29:07.556 --> 02:29:12.122
Before all the world, I declare...

02:29:13.255 --> 02:29:17.455
...this woman is my wife.

02:29:19.188 --> 02:29:25.056
Our tie, my dearest, is a bond of love.

02:29:26.188 --> 02:29:30.000
With love, I give you my heart...

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:30.255
With love, I give you my heart...

02:29:31.123 --> 02:29:35.188
...until death do us part.

02:29:44.455 --> 02:29:51.789
In the arms of your faithful husband,
enjoy a happier destiny.

02:29:57.422 --> 02:29:59.789
Be silent!

02:30:08.922 --> 02:30:12.123
No more resistance!

02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:23.922
Do not arouse my anger!

02:30:32.889 --> 02:30:37.856
Her chains are now broken.

02:30:40.522 --> 02:30:45.089
I am putting an end to your cruelty.

02:30:56.522 --> 02:31:00.000
You have no further claim
on this innocent girl.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:01.889
You have no further claim
on this innocent girl.

02:31:06.023 --> 02:31:09.155
Your greedy plot has failed.

02:31:31.622 --> 02:31:36.422
Your greedy plot has failed.

02:32:37.188 --> 02:32:43.856
Poor girl, you were his victim.

02:32:45.255 --> 02:32:49.756
You lived under an evil tyrant.

02:33:02.188 --> 02:33:10.222
You were subject
to his barbarous chains.

02:33:18.089 --> 02:33:23.155
Now let pleasure replace your sorrow.

02:33:29.322 --> 02:33:30.000
In the arms of your faithful husband...

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:37.288
In the arms of your faithful husband...

02:33:38.522 --> 02:33:44.689
...at last you will enjoy liberty.

02:34:23.422 --> 02:34:24.989
Dear friends!

02:34:25.155 --> 02:34:27.889
Never fear!

02:34:28.956 --> 02:34:30.000
- Our bond...
-...shall never be broken!

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:33.255
- Our bond...
-...shall never be broken!

02:34:34.155 --> 02:34:37.122
It will bind you to her forever.

02:35:05.355 --> 02:35:13.889
I am the most joyous
and blissful of lovers.

02:35:17.322 --> 02:35:23.155
May these happy moments last forever.

02:35:43.822 --> 02:35:48.456
I am the most joyous of lovers.

02:35:58.822 --> 02:36:00.000
May these happy moments last forever.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.455
May these happy moments last forever.

02:36:32.956 --> 02:36:40.322
My loving heart has
 never known such happiness.

02:36:41.056 --> 02:36:47.889
May the joy of this moment
endure all my life!

02:37:04.089 --> 02:37:06.989
Life offers no greater pleasure...

02:37:07.255 --> 02:37:11.589
...than the union of two loving hearts.

02:37:12.188 --> 02:37:15.722
May this joy endure all my life!

02:39:37.222 --> 02:39:39.889
So everything was my fault....

02:39:40.756 --> 02:39:43.155
It certainly was!

02:39:43.789 --> 02:39:48.522
And you betrayed me!
You acted as their witness.

02:39:50.689 --> 02:39:53.822
The Count made me an offer...

02:39:54.322 --> 02:39:57.722
...and I just couldn't say no!

02:40:01.622 --> 02:40:08.922
I thought I could stop them
by taking away the balcony ladder.

02:40:09.956 --> 02:40:12.322
That was really...

02:40:13.822 --> 02:40:16.589
..."The Useless Precaution!"

02:40:30.123 --> 02:40:36.056
May the memory of this 
happy union live on forever.

02:40:36.355 --> 02:40:41.956
I'll blow out my lantern.
I'm not needed any longer.

02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:47.389
May eternal love and fidelity
rule your hearts.

02:40:54.589 --> 02:40:58.489
This blissful time erases all pain.

02:41:05.522 --> 02:41:07.622
I breathe freely again!

02:41:14.056 --> 02:41:18.722
May eternal love and fidelity
rule your hearts.

02:41:20.255 --> 02:41:26.689
You accepted the humble Lindoro
and his love for you.

02:41:26.789 --> 02:41:30.000
Now a brighter future awaits you.
Come rejoice with me!

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.856
Now a brighter future awaits you.
Come rejoice with me!
